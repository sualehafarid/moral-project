Prosocial behavior suggests individuals should act in ways that benefit others, but here the protagonist's action benefits them at others' expense. Norm violations are actions that deviate from social norms, and cutting in line is a clear violation. Step 3: Moral standards and ethical considerations are based on fairness, respect for others, and following agreed-upon rules. Step 4: Analyze the protagonist's potential reasoning: empathy for the baby could be a possible justification, yet it does not justify violating the rights of others in line. Step 5: Consider the impact on others: their time and patience are undervalued when someone cuts in line. Step 6: Evaluate the ethical principle: the ends do not justify the means when it comes to violating norms and disrespecting others.",
