        1. Problem Identification: Recognize and clearly define the ethical dilemma or moral issue at hand.
        2. Stakeholder Analysis: Identify all parties involved or affected by the decision and consider their perspectives.
        3. Context Evaluation: Analyze the contextual factors, such as cultural, social, and legal considerations, that influence the scenario.
        4. Gather Information: Collect relevant facts and data surrounding the issue to have an informed understanding.
        5. Consequence Weighing: Assess the potential outcomes of various actions, considering both short-term and long-term effects.
        6. Ethical Framework Application: Apply relevant ethical theories or principles, such as utilitarianism, deontology, or virtue ethics, to evaluate actions.
        7. Intent Evaluation: Consider the motives and intentions of the individuals involved in the decision-making process.
        8. Principle Prioritization: Determine which ethical values or principles take precedence in the given situation.
        9. Option Generation: Develop a range of possible actions or solutions to address the moral issue.
        10. Scenario Simulation: Visualize or predict the practical implications and ramifications of each option.
        11. Integrity Check: Reflect on how the decision aligns with personal and communal moral values and integrity.
        12. Consultation: Seek advice or perspectives from others, if needed, to ensure a well-rounded consideration.
        13. Decision Articulation: Make a well-reasoned decision and articulate the rationale behind it, including any moral trade-offs.
        14. Implementation Strategy: Plan how to practically carry out the chosen course of action.
        15. Reflection and Review: After implementation, reflect on the decision's outcomes and whether it met ethical standards, using the insights gained for future moral reasoning.

Given this scenario: "[SCENARIO]".
Identify which of these phases are present in the following reasoning: "[REASONING]". Only output a JSON file with the keys being the phases of reasoning and value being the span (string indices interval) in the reasoning for the phase. Answer in English only."""

prompt2 = """You are a moral psychology expert. Given the following ethical frameworks considered in moral reasoning:

        1. Utilitarianism: Focuses on the consequences of actions, aiming to maximize overall happiness or minimize suffering. It is often summarized as striving for "the greatest good for the greatest number."
        2. Deontology: Emphasizes following moral rules or duties regardless of the consequences. Associated with Immanuel Kant, it stresses the importance of doing what is morally "right" based on principles.
        3. Virtue Ethics: Centers on the character and virtues of individuals rather than specific actions. It encourages the development of moral virtues such as courage, temperance, and wisdom.
        4. Ethical Egoism: Suggests that actions are morally right if they promote one's own best interests, though this doesn't necessarily mean acting selfishly at the expense of others.
        5. Care Ethics: Highlights the importance of care, empathy, and maintaining relationships in moral reasoning. It focuses on the specifics of interpersonal relationships and the context of ethical decisions.
        6. Social Contract Theory: Posits that moral and political obligations are based on a contract or agreement among individuals to form a society. It emphasizes mutual consent and cooperation for the common good.
        7. Rights-Based Ethics: Centers on the protection and respect of individuals' rights, such as the right to life, freedom, and privacy. It often overlaps with legal rights but also considers moral rights.
        8. Moral Relativism: Suggests that moral judgments and ethical standards are culturally and individually relative, meaning that there is no absolute moral truth applicable in all situations.
        9. Divine Command Theory: Asserts that moral values and duties are grounded in the commands of a divine being or religious teachings.
        10. Natural Law Theory: Based on the idea that moral principles are derived from human nature and the natural order of the world. It suggests that right and wrong are inherent in the world.

Given this scenario: "[SCENARIO]".
Determine which of the following ethical frameworks are emphasized in the given reasoning: "[REASONING]".
